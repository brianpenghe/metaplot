# metaplot1
This folder contains two scripts:
metageneplot.cpp takes a .bed file for regions and a .bedGraph file for signals and compute the coverage of the signals over the regions in an averaged manner
aaaplot_nuc.cpp takes a .bed file for coordinates of reference points (TSS and TTS, for example) and a .bedGraph file for signals and compute the average coverage near reference positions at nucleotide resolution
